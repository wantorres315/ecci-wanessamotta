The system was developed with laravel and vue. In the first part, an interface was created to show all the products to the logged in user. In parallel, an API was also developed that returns only some products (I didn't use this anywhere, I just did it because it was in the statement)

I used the Inertia resource to make some layouts with authentication and pagination.

I also used the seed resource to create a password for users based on external_reference. (I don't think this was necessary, but as I wanted to authenticate with a password, I thought this would be interesting)



Thanks for the opportunity
